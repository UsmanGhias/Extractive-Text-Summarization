# Extractive Text Summarization with all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Text summarization is a crucial tool utilized by numerous websites and applications, including CODCrafters.com, to generate concise and informative summaries of articles, courses, and various other forms of lengthy documents. The primary goal of summarization is to condense extensive texts while preserving the most important points from the source content.

## Types of Summarization

There are two primary approaches to text summarization:

1. **Extractive Summarization:** The extractive approach entails selecting the most significant phrases and sentences directly from the source document. It essentially "extracts" or copies these sentences to construct the summary. This method is akin to highlighting key portions of the text.

2. **Abstractive Summarization:** Abstractive summarization takes a more creative approach. It generates new phrases and terms that may not be present in the source document while preserving the core ideas and concepts. This technique requires a deeper understanding of the text and is often considered more challenging than extractive summarization.

## Model Used: all-MiniLM-L6-v2

In this project, we employ the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for text summarization. This model is known for its effectiveness in generating high-quality extractive summaries from various types of text data.

## NLTK and Transformers

This project leverages NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), a powerful library for natural language processing in Python. Additionally, it integrates Transformers, a state-of-the-art deep learning library for NLP tasks, including summarization.
